## Museums

The Booth Natural History museum a wonderfully quirky -- if a little macabre -- museum just outside of town. There's also an open air theatre nearby. See [other museums](https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/whats-on/).

## Sea swimming

Getting in a sea is a big thing in Brighton. The beach in town can get quite rough, but if you're able to get out of town Kingston Beach has a good scene, and sometimes a sauna.
